## Hello, my name is Viktor!

- I graduated from Faculty of Science in Zagreb; field Mathematics education
- I worked for 5 years in IT business; mathematics, analitics, with occasional process automating coding to help myself (and others, of course 😉)
- I was formally educated in C and SQL language
- I learned Python few years ago, eavesdropping on my girlfriend's Python developer course 😄
- I finished a course for SQL administration

**Fun fact 🐱:** As I care for over 40 abandoned cats, I created a mini app using AppSheet to track their general info, vet appointments and bills

As I constantly keep comming back to some sort of programming, I've decided it's time for me to start contributing to
real life problems and find a job in software development. I'm looking forward to meeting my new team 🎆!
