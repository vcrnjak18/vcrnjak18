## Hello, my name is Viktor!

- I graduated from Faculty of Science in Zagreb; field Mathematics education
- I worked for 5 years in IT business; mathematics, data analytics, with occasional process automating Apps script coding to help myself (and others, of course 😉)
- I was formally educated in C and SQL language
- I learned Python few years ago, eavesdropping on my girlfriend's Python developer course 😄
- I finished a course for SQL administration

**Fun fact 🐱:** As I care for a *great* number of abandoned cats, I created a mini app using AppSheet to track their general info, vet appointments and bills

As I constantly keep coming back to some sort of programming, I've decided it's time for me to start contributing to
real life problems and find a job in software development. I'm looking forward to meeting my new team, learning and making a difference!
